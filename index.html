    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Revathi's photo" />
    <p>My name is Revathi, a third-year student at MRECW with a deep interest in technology and innovation. I recently completed a 2-month internship with Infosys Springboard, where I gained industry exposure and enhanced my technical skills. I also participated in the on-campus Pragathi Cohort workshop, which helped me strengthen my teamwork and problem-solving abilities. I have worked on impactful projects such as an Epileptic Seizure Prediction System using deep learning, a Financial Literacy Portal, and a Sign Language Recognition system using machine learning to support communication for the hearing and speech impaired. Iâ€™m a dedicated and curious learner, eager to grow through hands-on experience and contribute effectively to your organization.</p>
